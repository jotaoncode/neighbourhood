# Almagro Neighbourhood

## Synopsis

This is a project to show and search for my favourites places in my neighbourhood.

## Motivation

This is a nanodegree project. The challenge is to create a map with google maps that show my neighbourhood and some of the places I like to go by adding marks.

## Installation

Everything you need is internet as it uses google maps api and street view api. And then access to index.html through the browser.

## Run

To run the application follow this steps:

1- run in command line terminal

$ node server

2- Open a browser to the address:

http://localhost:3000

You will see the menu at the bottom left corner, that has the book marks of the neighbourhood I lived for 23 years, you can choose any of them in order to see a little description about it. Some of this information is from Foursquare.

## Summary

After this I learnt a bit knockout JS framework, Google API, Foursquare API, and Material Design, Handlebars.
