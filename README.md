# Almagro Neighbourhood
## Synopsis
This is a project to show and search for my favourites places in my neighbourhood.
## Motivation
This is a nanodegree project. The challenge is to create a map with google maps that show my neighbourhood and some of the places I like to go by adding marks.
## Installation
Everything you need is internet as it uses google maps api and street view api. And then access to index.html through the browser.
## Notes
After installation, when you start running this application, you will see an icon in bottom left corner of a Menu icon. This way you can choose any of the markers you need, and eventually make a filter on any of them.
## Summary
After this I learnt a bit knockout JS framework, google API and Material Design.
